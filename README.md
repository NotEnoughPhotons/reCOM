# Intro
This repository houses the reverse engineered code of the SOCOM games, alongside the engine, GameZ.

It is a work in progress, and a lot needs to make sure the SOCOM experience is one-to-one with the PlayStation 2.

# Compilation
1. Clone this project by doing ``git clone https://github.com/Not-Enough-Photons/reCOM`` into a directory of your choice, or by downloading the source code ZIP and extracting it anywhere
2. CD into the main directory of the project
3. Type ``premake5 vs2022`` or any other build profile you know
4. Open the project in an IDE and do Left Control + Shift + B, or click the play button
5. Drag all DLL files into ``output/debug`` or ``output/release``
6. That's it!

# Background
Currently, I (adamdev) am the sole contributor to this project. I have been using Ghidra to reverse engineer the binaries of the games, to some luck.

I have sourced a demo disk that contains all debug symbols (thank you Zero1UP!), which is indispensable to this project.

# Disclaimer
This repository **will NOT** contain any copyrighted assets. Models, textures, and sounds will be sourced from a legal copy game disc.

If you are using this project to play SOCOM titles, you **MUST** own legal copies of the games for this to work. Borrowing does **NOT** count. Any technical assistance given will be for owners who legally own the game. We will not distribute illegal copies of the game with the project.
